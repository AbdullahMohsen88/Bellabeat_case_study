## Proposed Strategy

-   **Gamification:** Launch a "7.5k Step Challenge" within the app to motivate users to reach the health baseline.

-   **Smart Notifications:** Use a gentle nudge when user is sedentary motivating them to do activity. Use reminders when the user usually has a "gap" in their schedule.

-   **Sleep Coaching:** Use "Night-time Wind-down" reminders to help users achieve the 7-9 hour sleep target for optimal recovery.

## Conclusion

By focusing on these behavioral nudges, Bellabeat can transition from a simple tracking tool to an essential wellness partner, increasing user retention and brand loyalty.
